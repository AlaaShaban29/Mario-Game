# Mario Objects

##Introduction
Mario Objects is a Mario game  + level editor created by me when I was at collage.
This was my first project I made in c# to learn the language.
I started it as little project to learn how to use bitmaps and surfaces in c# and 
because of my deep love with the mario game I decided to practice on mario sprites.

As time goes by I added more and more objects to the game , timers, mario phisics,
intersections with other objects and its became a really nice projects so in addition
I added to it a nice level editor to be able to create some type of levels.

Its not perfect and many parts of the game are not as they are supposed so be but as
a result I was very proud of it.
